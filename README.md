# JustChat 
An instant messaging application developed as part of the CS314 'Elements of Software Engineering' course at Portland State University (Winter 2025 term). The project showcases key software engineering principles, including design, development, testing, and collaboration. This is still very much a work in progress. Many simplifications were made due to the scope of the project and the time we had to complete it. In light of that, we want to improve security significantly and refactor our code.

Collaborators: Abdurrahman Alyajouri, Nelson Nguyen.

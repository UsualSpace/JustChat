# Setup
Once you have navigated to the frontend directory, run "npm install". Then create a folder in the same directory called ".env". Inside ".env", create an environment variable called VITE_SERVER_URL and set it equal to the link to your backend server. For example: "http://localhost:4000", where the "4000" will be the port number matching the PORT variable specified in the backend directory's ".env" file once you create it.
